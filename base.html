                        <h1>Vril Society</h1>
                        <p>The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend, a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. </p>
                        <p>
                        The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them.The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended houses 12,000 families, one of the largest groups.</p>

This mastery gives them access to an extraordinary force that can be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employ to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril include the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular are immense, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.</p>

                    <h1>OPERATION HIGHJUMP</h1>
                    <p>In 1947, Ladislao Szabo published a book "Hitler is Alive" where he claimed that two U-boats had taken fleeing senior Nazis to Antarctica as part of a submarine convoy.The commander of U-977 in particular, Heinz Schaeffer denied this but the rumour still spread.<br> </p><p>In another version of the story, it is Hitler's ashes that were taken to Antarctica and placed in a special ice-cave along with Nazi treasure.<br>

                        <br>Szabo claimed a Nazi Antarctic base called "New Berchetesgaden" had been built in 1938-39, this idea has been taken up by several authors over the years often building on earlier embellishments with tales becoming ever more fantastical as time went on.</p>

                    <p>A German base in Antarctica was established just before the war by the Schwabenland, this was expanded during the war being regularly supplied by submarine deliveries, it was used to develop sophisticated secret weapons. This base was spied on by the British who attempted unsuccessfully to destroy it in an SAS raid in 1945. Operation Highjump was sent to attack the base, though they were repulsed by secret weapons (flying saucers are often mentioned), then eventually the base was destroyed by nuclear bombs in 1958. By the time of its eventual destruction the base is often described as being populated by hundreds or even thousands of people and defended by a range of sophisticated weaponry including the flying saucers. </p>

                    <h1>UNIT 731</h1>
                    <p>For 40 years, the horrific activities of “Unit 731” remained one the most closely guarded secrets of World War II</p>
                    <p>Deliberately infected with plague, anthrax, cholera and other pathogens, an estimated 3,000 of enemy soldiers and civilians were used as guinea pigs. Some of the more horrific experiments included vivisection without anesthesia and pressure chambers to see how much a human could take before his eyes popped out.

                        Unit 731 was set up in 1938 in Japanese-occupied China with the aim of developing biological weapons.</p>

                <div class="b3">
                        <p>Many of the prisoners, who were murdered in the name of research, were used in hideous vivisection and other medical experiments, including barbaric trials to determine the effect of frostbite on the human body.<br><br> To ease the conscience of those involved, the prisoners were referred to not as people or patients but as “Maruta”, or wooden logs. Before Japan’s surrender, the site of the experiments was completely destroyed, so that no evidence is left.<br><br>
                    Testimonies from participants shed some light about parts of the experiments.<br><br> “The fellow knew that it was over for him, and so he didn’t struggle when they led him into the room and tied him down. But when I picked up the scalpel, that’s when he began screaming. I cut him open from the chest to the stomach, and he screamed terribly, and his face was all twisted in agony. He made this unimaginable sound, he was screaming so horribly. But then finally he stopped. This was all in a day’s work for the surgeons, but it really left an impression on me because it was my first time.”</p>

                <h1>ROMUVA</h1>
                <p>Of all the European nations, Lithuania held on to its traditional religion the longest, with their ancient rituals and keep the sacred fires (Ugnė, Skt. Agni अग्नि).<br><br>“Romuva” means “temple, sanctuary” as well as “abode of inner peace”. But the name Romuva (from the Baltic rām-, ‘calm, serene, quiet’, which is identical to Skt. Rām राम) goes back to the deepest resonances in Indo-European beliefs.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class = "c2">
                <img src="romuva.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="c3">
                <p>An important symbol of the Romuva is the Austras Koks, “tree of dawn,” or “tree of life,” Skt. Auśas kakṣa औषस् कक्ष, which is another name for Kalpataru, the tree of life.<br><br>
Indraja, इन्द्रज, born of Indra, is the name for Jupiter.<br>Perkūnas, Skt. Parjanya, पर्जन्य. The God of Thunder; father of all beings, an aspect ofIndra, इन्द्र. <br>Ašvieniai, Skt. Aśvinau अश्विनौ. They are the horsemen to the gods who symbolize the morning and the evening lights. They are the children of Dievas in Romuva and Dyaus in the Vedas.<br>Veju Māte (Skt. Vāyu Mātā वायु माता) is the Wind Mother.<br>
<br></p></div>
            <div class="c4"><p>In both the Romuva and the Vedas, the highest divinity, Dievas/Brahma, is neutral in the affairs of the world. There is duality in the experienced world as represented by Perkūnas-Veles pair which mirrors the Vedic duality of Deva-Asura. Other dualities likewise are the masculine and feminine deities Perkūnas-Žemė or Parjanya-Kṣamā which are mirrored in the marriage of Saulė-Mėnuo and Sūryā-Soma (Māsa). In the Vedic system, as in Romuva, the oppositions are complementary and, therefore, essential in defining the overall unity. <br> two other Eastern-Slavic Deities have often been considered to be of Indian origin based on the words from Sanskrit. Those two Deities are the God Swarog, whose name comes from Sanskrit Svarga (meaning turbulent, cloudy, dim sky) and the Goddess Mokosh, whose name most likely originates from the Sanskrit word moksha (meaning “liberation from the eternal circle of reincarnation”).</p>
